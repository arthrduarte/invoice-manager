# What challenges did you face in completing this assignment?
- Honestly, my biggest problem was using Bootstrap lol. It's the first time I tried to use it and the responsive part was kinda tricky
- Also, I tried to create a function for the status' background color but it didn't work. Hence why I did it directly in the template

# What did you find most interesting about creating PHP templates?
- The possibility of displaying different information with little code

# How does PHP differ from other programming languages you have used?
- I fooled around with EJS, which has a simmilar way of allowing you to embed code directly to HTML
