## What additional code would be required for the Invoice Manager application to accept multiple different file types?
We should add the 'multiple' property to input file. 

## How would you improve the Invoice Manager application? What new features would you add or improve?
It would be nice to implement an authentication with user and admin, where user can only see the current invoices and admins can add, edit, delete, upload files etc

## What have you learned from completing the Invoice Manager application? How will those skills help you in the future?
We are currently in the 3rd term and this was the only course so far that really teached how to develop a web application, and I'd say the skills will be valuable forever.
